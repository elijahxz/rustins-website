# rustins-website
This was a personal project I developed for a family member, Rustin, for his handyman business. 

I developed this application in Summer 2023. The front end was developed then linked to an JavaScript Email API (SMPT JS: https://smtpjs.com/)

There are two things that I would like to improve on this project in the future

  - Increased security:

    - currently dependent SMPT's security, so it would be nice to implement more protocols for sensitive data

  - A better user interface

    - I did all of the styling using CSS, but it would be nice to revamp the project using Bootstrap or some other CSS library.
    - The interface for mobile devices can have bugs

Note: The photo limit is ~7.5 mb per SMPT's protocals.
